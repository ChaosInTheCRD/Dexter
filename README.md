# Dexter

<center>Don't expect your engineers to know why or how they should declare their image references for better security, leave it to Dexter.</center>

## What does Dexter Do?
Dexter can be placed into your CI processes to scrape through the repository and find files that contain image references, with the aim of pinning them to the immutable digest.

## What can Dexter Find?

Dexter currently has a small selection of parsers that are able to find image references within the file types they are designed to assess. These are:
- Kubernetes (currently supports Pod, Deployment, Replicaset, Statefulset, Daemonset, Job, CronJob)
- Dockerfile

## What Problem does this solve?

Let's say I have a file with an image declared like so:

```yaml
image: 'grafana/grafana:4.2.0'
```

The `4.2.0` is what is called an image tag. Image tags (as you might have guessed), make it quick and easy to point to an image, but it is not an immutable identity to an image itself. The tag points to a long (not very nice to look at) sha256 hash known as an image digest:

```
7ff7f9b2501a5d55b55ce3f58d21771b1c5af1f2a4ab7dbf11bef7142aae7033
```

Image digests are great because they are the immutable identity that an image tag points to. But why do I care? A-ha! This is where Dexter comes in.

the `4.2.0` tag points to the `7ff7f9b2501a5d55b55ce3f58d21771b1c5af1f2a4ab7dbf11bef7142aae7033` digest identity of the image sat in the registry. However, nothing is stopping me as someone with write access to the registry, to point the `4.2.0` tag at a different image. In most cases this could be innocent changes to the image, but to do such a thing is *never* good practice. In the worst case, this could be a malicious modification to the image so it contains a cypto-miner, or in other words; a supply-chain attack.

Once you have applied Dexter against your repository, your image reference (taking the grafana image shown above as an example) will look like:

```yaml
image: index.docker.io/grafana/grafana@sha256:7ff7f9b2501a5d55b55ce3f58d21771b1c5af1f2a4ab7dbf11bef7142aae7033
```

Now if this image is running in your estate, you will not be susceptible to an image tag getting hijacked and you will no longer get hit by the dreaded crypto-miner under this use case! woohoo!

## Quickstart

To quickly test out the tool on your repository, simply execute the following command from within the Dexter repository:

```bash
go run . manipulate --directory <your-repository-directory>
```

## Dexter Configuration

Dexter has a simple configuration file for allowing you to specify how you would like it to behave when it executes against your repository. *Please note that this is currently very basic, and there is an intention to make this more fully featured in the near future*.

### Parsers

This allows you to select the parsers that you wish to use:

```yaml
parsers:
- "dockerfile"
- "kubernetes"
```

Of course there are not many parsers yet ðŸ‘€ but hopefully this will become handy in the near future.

### Ignore

If you have specific files or even references that exist within the path you are scanning that you do not want to touch, Dexter will ensure that they are left alone to the letter. Just ensure that you add them to the `ignore` field inside the Dexter configuration file:

```yaml
ignore:
   files:
   - cmd/root.go
   - test.yaml
   references:
   - grafana/grafana:latest
```


Feel free to give it a try!
